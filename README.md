# âœˆ Airline Database Analysis with SQL

This project contains a series of advanced SQL queries and insights derived from a normalized airline database. It demonstrates how to use SQL for extracting business-critical insights related to flight operations, passenger behavior, aircraft utilization, and revenue analytics.

## Dataset Overview

The project uses a comprehensive **relational airline database**, consisting of the following tables:
- `flights`
- `aircrafts`
- `airports`
- `boarding_passes`
- `seats`
- `bookings`
- `tickets`
- `ticket_flights`

## SQL Use Cases & Business Questions Answered

Each query in this repository solves a specific real-world airline business problem, including:

1. **Departure Delays Analysis** â€“ Calculate average delay for late departures.
2. **Aircraft Usage** â€“ Count how often each aircraft is used.
3. **Revenue Tracking** â€“ Total revenue generated per flight.
4. **Boarding Patterns** â€“ Average boarding number per flight.
5. **Seat Occupancy & Fare Conditions** â€“ Compare boarding passes issued vs available seats and analyze fare types.
6. **Top Revenue Flights** â€“ Identify the highest earning flights.
7. **Flight Duration by Aircraft Model** â€“ Find average scheduled flight times per aircraft model.
8. **Airport Activity** â€“ Count departures and arrivals at each airport.
9. **Booking Trends** â€“ Analyze daily bookings and revenue over time.
10. **Frequent Routes** â€“ Discover most common travel routes.
11. **Passenger Boarding Summary** â€“ Number of passengers per flight.
12. **Occupancy Rate per Flight** â€“ Measure how full flights are.
13. **Fare Spend per Passenger** â€“ Total money spent by each customer.
14. **Flight Occupancy Visualization** *(Optional in future)* â€“ Visualize occupancy trends using BI tools.
